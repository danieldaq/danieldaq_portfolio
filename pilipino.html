				<h4>Illustration & Branding</h4>

				<p class="narrow">Mga Kapatid’s annual Pilipino Culture Night (PCN) production is a student-run celebration of Pilipino-American culture through acting, song, and dance. This project expresses the show’s culture and themes through illustration.</p>
				<p class="narrow">The 26th Annual Pilipino Culture Night is titled “Walang Kapalit” (translated as Irreplaceable) and is set in 1960/70’s San Francisco during the International Hotel Anti-Eviction Movement. The PCN coordinators needed a poster image that embodied the show’s themes of social justice, community empowerment, and cultural solidarity that would be used to promote the show.</p>

				<h4>Screen printed posters from the 1960/70's</h4>
			</div>

			<div class="case">
				<p class="narrow">The screen printing process was a major tool for the anti-eviction movement in getting their thoughts heard visually, so I wanted the main images to have an edgy screen-printed look similar to protest posters made in the 1960/70's.</p>

			<div class="case">
				<p class="narrow">Creating solidarity between the protesters during the I-Hotel movement and the audience members watching this PCN in the present was a major goal for the show’s scriptwriters and director. Illustrating people from both past and present onto the same image was a great way to embody this.</p>

				<p class="narrow">After illustrating each element, piecing together the final poster image that would be used in flyers, posters, and the show's program cover had a cinematic quality to it.</p>

				<p class="narrow">A fist in the air is seen as a symbol for empowerment and solidarity, so drawing these images subtly into the background was a great addition. I also used these fists for the production’s t-shirt screen print design.</p>

				<h4>Motion Graphics & Typography</h4>

			<div class="case">
				<p class="narrow">The idea of bringing meaning and motion together in motion graphics was always intriguing to me. When it came to motion typography, I was able to join the two by creating a lyric video for Aaliyah's song "Are You That Somebody?"</p>
				<p class="narrow">The challenge with this project was deciding how to visually represent Aaliyah's words to convey the feeling of her singing and the meaning behind her words. </p>

				<h4>Initial storyboarding</h4>
			</div>
			
			<div class="case">
				<p class="narrow">I wanted to create various motions for the lyrics to showcase the alternation between fast and slow rhythms of the song. I also included some sketches and a video clip of my crying niece to give more visual variety.</p>

			<div class="case">
				<p class="narrow">I added in clips of the song's original music video at the beginning and ending of the video, but I feel that the rest of video was also able to show Aaliyah's musical dynamic pretty well.</p>
